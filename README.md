# firm_scrape

Warning: This project is incomplete and hacky.

This was a project to make a "universal web scraper" for various types of professional firms.
The result is a full stack web application in flask, with sqlalchemy and vanilla html/css/js.
A full implementation, that is truly universal, would probably require a technology like GPT-4 (particularly its image processing capabilities, which at the time of writing are not available to the public)
