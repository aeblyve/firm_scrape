# firm_scrape

Warning: This project is incomplete and hacky.

FirmScrape was a project to make a "universal web scraper" for various types of professional firms, by making some assumptions about page layouts.

The result is a full stack web application in flask, with sqlalchemy and vanilla html/css/js.

A FirmScrape 2, using GPT-4, is currently in development.
